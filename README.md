# ECC-Based-Ecrypted-Communicating-System
*A communicating system based on OpenSSL's ECC algorithms*
## Introduction
This is a holiday project written by Miter, Tony, and more to be added. It is a basic implementation of a local network chatting system based on the SM2 encryption method, with a cross-platorm CLI or GUI.

**⚠️WARNING⚠️ This project is currently in development. It is not intended for production usage.**
